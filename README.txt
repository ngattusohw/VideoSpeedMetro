***** Welcome to the video metronome syncer V1******
This program allows you to upload a video locally and dynamically change its speed to for live music video showings!


How to use:

This program calculates how fast the video should be playing based on BPM

1.) Enter the Bpm the song should be played at and press the button labeled "push inital"

2.) Click on the button labeled "choose file" and select the video from your computer... you can use the given "metronome.mp4" to test how the program works.

3.) Maximize the video and tap the spacebar or "m" at the bpm that the band is playing, the video speed will automatically adjust

4.) If you need to switch speeds quickly press "x" to reset the current bpm and then tap the space bar again at the rate the music is going

5.) If you need to quickly set the video speed back to its original/inital speed press the "t" key

*Different Browsers support different video types, for example Chrome supports .mp4 but safari does not. If your browser does not support your video type, please try another browser*

*Known bugs: If you click "push inital" more then once, more video controllers will appear, although they don't actually hinder the actual program, it just creates an eye sore*
